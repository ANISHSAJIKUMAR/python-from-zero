# python-from-zero

Welcome to my Python learning repo!

This is where I document my journey of learning Python from the ground up. It includes:

- 📚 Notes and summaries from my study sessions
- 🧠 Practice problems and solutions
- 🧪 Small experiments and code snippets
- 🚀 Mini-projects as I build confidence

I'll keep updating this repo as I move from beginner to intermediate topics.

Feel free to explore, fork, or suggest improvements!
